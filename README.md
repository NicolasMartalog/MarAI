# MarAI (Mario Reinforcement Learning)
This project is to build a reinforcemnt learning model that is able successfully complete Super Mario Bros' levels with Proximal Policy Optimization and Generalized Advatage Estimation (PPO+GAE). This project was built with OpenAI-gym, nes_py, numpy, matplotlib and pytorch. Inside the checkpoints directories are weights for the level/plot of average reward throughout training episodes.
